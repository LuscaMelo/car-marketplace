        description: "Simply put, the 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 and the all-out track-attack GT3 RS are utterly transcendent, blending everything we love about the standard 911 with otherworldly performance, uncompromised driving enjoyment, and hot-lap capability. A naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six engine makes demonic sounds as it howls up to its 9000 rpm redline, producing 502 horsepower along the way in the GT3 and GT3 Touring. That same engine is twisted to 518 horsepower in the new GT3 RS, but it's that model's wild race-car aerodynamic elements—ideas cribbed from GT and Formula 1 race cars—that comprise its major engineering advancements. A six-speed manual is standard in GT3 models but we've proven the optional seven-speed PDK automatic is quicker, as it shifts quicker than a human and seems to be linked to the driver's cerebral cortex. The GT3 RS comes only with the PDK gearbox. While the GT3 and GT3 Touring models are designed to thrill on the world's most challenging race courses, they're nearly as supple-riding and easy to live with as the regular 911 when driven on city streets."

        description: "The spunky little sibling in the Volvo lineup is the 2023 XC40 SUV, which blends Volvo's safety-first ethos and upscale ambiance with a more youthful character. The XC40's cabin is practical and nicely trimmed, and the seating position is much higher than that of rivals such as the BMW X1 and the Mercedes-Benz GLA-class. A host of technology features are at the ready as well, including Volvo's advanced driver-assistance tech and a new Google-based infotainment system. Two four-cylinder powertrains are available—both with a 48-volt hybrid system—but only the more powerful of the two has all-wheel drive. An electric version is also available if you're looking for a more eco-friendly option, but we review the XC40 Recharge separately."

        description: "Elegant design and purposeful engineering combine in the 2023 Volvo XC60, and the result is a distinctive option in the luxury-SUV class. Along with its tastefully styled exterior, the XC60's cabin is an exercise in well-tailored minimalism—think Prada meets IKEA. A trio of four-cylinder powertrains is offered—the 247-hp B5, the 295-hp B6, and the 455-hp T8 plug-in hybrid. All of are reasonably fuel-efficient and feel good from behind the wheel, with performance that ranges from perky to downright quick depending upon which powertrain you choose. Technology is prioritized too; Volvo includes popular driver-assistance and safety features standard. We don't love the XC60's Google-based infotainment interface, but it works well enough even if it doesn't look particularly appealing. Other compact SUVs are more practical, especially the Audi Q5 and the BMW X3, which both offer more cargo space. But the Volvo's interior room isn't far off, and its strong curb appeal makes up for these minor shortcomings."

        description: "The last few Corvettes came with a bogey time from Chevrolet engineers, but aside from some development laps at VIR, the Z06 hadn't yet set a good time on the Grand Course. At other tracks, the Z06 ran comparable laps to the 755-hp C7 ZR1. So we were excited to beat our old ZR1 time by nearly a second despite the ZR1's 85-hp advantage and 4.5-mph higher peak speed on the Front Straight. The Z06's 2:38.6 time is the fifth fastest in Lightning Lap history, and it's also the best lap time for a car with a naturally aspirated engine. Everything quicker is considerably faster down the straights and costs more than twice as much. Please don't think the engine is a weak point—far from it. Out on the street, this Z06 is all motor, screaming at 8500 rpm, startling pedestrians with its wail. But on the street, there is no safe way to exploit the lofty limits of this chassis. It's capable of 1.22 g's in Turn 1 and averages 133.4 mph when ascending the Climbing Esses. The longer we lapped it, the more we concluded that this Corvette is really meant for the track."

        description: "If we gave out an award for Most Improved Sports Car, the Toyota GR86 would very possibly be the big winner. This eminently entertaining rear-wheel-drive coupe's second generation arrived in 2022 and addressed our big issue with the original model: a weak engine. The second time around, power comes from a 228-hp flat-four with plenty of mid-range power, and although a six-speed manual comes standard (and is the only way to go), a six-speed automatic is available. You won't hear us telling you to opt for it. The GR86 is small and affordable, like, say, a Mazda MX-5 Miata, only with a tiny Porsche 911–type rear seat that enables you to take small fry along. Its hatchback body also affords reasonable cargo space, which the Miata doesn't offer, either. The GR86's mechanical twin, the Subaru BRZ, offers a virtually identical experience, so choosing between them ultimately comes down to which badge you prefer. As a 2+2 coupe built mainly for playtime, the GR86 does suffer from road noise, particularly on the highway, and the music produced by the boxer engine isn't exactly worth buying tickets to hear live. Still, plenty of cornering grip, great balance, sharp steering, and a rev-happy engine make the GR86 fun to drive, no matter where you're going. It's everything an entry-level sports car should be. And while we don't give a most improved trophy, we did give the GR 86 something even better: A 10Best award."

        description: "The tailored lines of the 2024 Range Rover Velar's exterior design fit the compact crossover's shape beautifully, but the SUV's driving demeanor is rather unforgettable. Despite sharing a platform with the delightfully agile Jaguar F-Pace, the Range Rover Velar has the fun tuned out of its chassis in the name of luxury. Two turbocharged engines are on offer—a 2.0-liter four and a 3.0-liter six—and all models come standard with all-wheel drive. While the Velar lacks the road manners we like in SUVs such as the BMW X3, the Genesis GV70, and the Porsche Macan, it does offer a posh cabin with more cargo space than the competition. Plus, it comes standard with the Range Rover name tattooed across its face—one luxury feature its rivals can't match."

        description: "The word “plug-in hybrid” probably calls to mind dorky but practical vehicles like the Toyota Prius Prime. But believe it or not, the sleek, low-slung Ferrari SF90 Stradale coupe and the SF90 Spider convertible also fit into that category, packing a twin-turbocharged V-8 and three electric motors. Instead of focusing on efficiency, however, the SF90 uses its electrified powertrain to boost performance—its 60-mph time of 2.0 seconds makes it officially the quickest car we've ever tested. Along with bedroom poster-worthy looks and mind-bending acceleration, the SF90’s interior is wrapped in rich, sweet-smelling leather and fitted with high-quality switchgear and a 16-inch digital gauge cluster. Unsurprisingly, the bonkers performance and classy cabin will cost you around half-a-million dollars, but if you can afford to plunk down that hefty sum, you’ll be able to enjoy one of the sharpest, most capable supercars on sale today—and, so far, the undisputed quickest."

        description: "Electrons, motors, battery packs, and kilowatts have added a host of new words to the automotive lexicon, but when it comes to the Audi e-tron GT EV, the vocabulary is simple: this thing is fun! A platform-mate to the impressive Porsche Taycan, the e-tron GT delivers a calm ride and frenetic acceleration. With a motor at each axle, the combined output starts at 522 horsepower and rises to as much as 637 in the most powerful RS e-tron GT model. We managed 240 miles of highway range with the RS e-tron GT during testing, which isn't brag-worthy in a segment that contains the Tesla Model S. The e-Tron GT does offer some compensation for its merely average range thanks to its 270-kW DC fast charger, which makes it one of the quickest charging EVs sold today. Its standard interior is made from recycled leather-free materials but its low roof and narrow cockpit make getting in and out a challenge for rear-seat riders. Audi's quickest EV is exciting to drive and great to look at but EVs with more range like the Tesla Model S make a better argument for living with all-electric transportation."

        description: "Expanding its EV offerings, Volvo is launching the small EX30 SUV with chic styling to go along with its expected high-tech platform. Single- and Dual-Motor versions are available, the former with a 268-hp rear-wheel-drive setup and the latter with a 422-hp all-wheel-drive arrangement that Volvo says makes the EX30 its quickest-accelerating vehicle to date. No matter which powertrain you choose, you'll get the same 64.0-kWh battery pack that is said to offer up to 275 miles of driving per charge. The EX30 sports cool LED lighting elements and Volvo's justly lauded comfy bucket seats, but its cabin makes sustainability a side dish to its style. Volvo has chosen recycled materials for the SUV's upholstery and partnered with carbon-neutral suppliers to give the EX30 an edge in environmental friendliness. The EX30 fits into the Volvo lineup below the C40 Recharge and XC40 Recharge duo and creates a new entry-level place in the brand's hierarchy."
